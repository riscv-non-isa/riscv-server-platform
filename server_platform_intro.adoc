== Introduction

The RISC-V Server Platform specification defines a standardized set of
hardware and sofware capabilities, that portable system software, such
as operating systems and hypervisors, can rely on being present in a RISC-V
server platform.

A server is a computing system designed to manage and distribute resources,
services, and data to other computers or devices on a network. It is often
referred to as a 'server' because it serves or provides information and
resources upon request. Such computing systems are designed to operate
continually and have higher requirements for capabilities such as RAS, security,
performance, and quality of service. Examples of servers include web servers,
file servers, database servers, mail servers, game servers, and more. This
specification focuses on defining requirements for general-purpose server
computing systems that may be used for one or more of these purposes.

The RISC-V server platform is defined as the collection of RVA profile-compliant
application processor harts, SoC hardware, peripherals, platform firmware,
boot/runtime services, and platform security services. The platform provides
hardware interfaces (e.g., harts, timers, interrupt controllers, PCIe root ports, etc.)
to portable system software. It also offers a set of standardized boot and runtime
services based on the UEFI and ACPI standards. To support provisioning and
platform management, it interfaces with a baseboard management controller (BMC)
through both in-band and out-of-band (OOB) management interfaces. The in-band
management interfaces support the use of standard manageability specifications
like MCTP, PLDM, IPMI, and Redfish for provisioning and management of the operating
system executing on the platform. The OOB interface supports the use of standard
manageability specifications like MCTP, PLDM, Redfish, and IPMI for functions such
as power management, telemetry, debug, and provisioning. The platform security model
includes guidelines and requirements for aspects such as debug authorization,
secure/measured boot, firmware updates, firmware resilience, and confidential
computing, among others.

The platform firmware, typically operating at privilege level M, is
considered part of the platform and is usually expected to be customized and
tailored to meet the requirements of the SoC hardware (e.g., initialization
of address decoders, memory controllers, RAS, etc.), boot/runtime services
and platform security.

This specification standardizes the rules for hardware and software
interfaces and capabilities by building on top of relevant RISC-V standards,
such as the RISC-V Architecture Profiles, Server SoC, Boot and Runtime Services
and Platform Security specifications for server software executing on the application
processor harts at privilege levels below M. It enables OS and hypervisor vendors to
support such platforms with a single binary OS image distribution model. The
rules provided by this specification represent a standard set of infrastructural
capabilities, encompassing areas where divergence is typically unnecessary and
where novelty is absent across implementations.

To be compliant with this specification, the server platform MUST support all
mandatory rules and MUST support the listed versions of the specifications.
This standard set of capabilities MAY be extended by a specific implementation with
additional standard or custom capabilities, including compatible later
versions of listed standard specifications. Portable system software MUST
support the specified mandatory capabilities to be compliant with this
specification.

The rules in this specification use the following format:

[width=100%]
[%header, cols="5,20"]
|===
| ID#     ^| Rules
| CAT_NNN  | The `CAT` is a category prefix that logically groups the
             rules and is followed by 3 digits - `NNN` - assigning a
             numeric ID to the rule.                                          +
                                                                              +
             The rules use the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
             "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
             "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" that are
             to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 cite:[RFC_2119] when,
             and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. When
             these words are not capitalized, they have their normal English
             meanings.
2+| _A rule or a group of rules may be followed by non-normative
    text providing context or justification for the rule. The
    non-normative text may also be used to reference sources that are the
    origin of the rule._

This specification groups the rules in the following broad categories:

* Hardware
* Firmware
* Security

=== Glossary

Most terminology has the standard RISC-V meaning. This table captures other terms used in the document. Terms in the document prefixed by 'PCIe' have the meaning defined in the PCI Express (PCIe) Base Specification cite:[PCI] (even if they are not in this table).
