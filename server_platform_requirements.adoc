== Server Platform Hardware Requirements

=== RISC-V Harts

A RISC-V server platform includes a RISC-V application processor and may include
one or more service processors. These service processors may provide services such
as security and power management to software executing on the application
processors, and they may themselves implement the RISC-V ISA. The requirements
in this section apply solely to harts in the application processors of the SoC.

|===
| ID#     ^| Requirement
| `RVA_010`  | The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support the
             RVA23 ISA profile cite:[RVA23].

| `RVA_020` a| The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support the
             following extensions:

             * Sv48
             * Svadu
             * Sdtrig
             * Sdext
             * Zkr
             * Ssccfg
             * Sscsrind
             * Ssstrict
             * Ssaia

2+| _Many of these mandated extensions are optional in the RVA23 ISA profile.
     This requirement is placed here as a placeholder. These mandates may be
     moved into a new ISA profile specification._

| `RVA_021` a| The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support
             the Ssctr extension with a CTR depth value of 32. Additional CTR
             depth values MAY be supported.

2+| _Mandating implementation of CTR depth of 32 provides a common CTR depth
     across implementations for purposes of VM migration._

| `RVA_022` a| The RISC-V application processor harts MUST raise an
             illegal-instruction exception when attempting to execute
             unimplemented opcodes or access unimplemented CSRs.

| `RVA_030`  | The ISA extensions and associated CSR field widths implemented by
             any of the RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST be
             identical.
2+| _The RVA23 profile supports a set of optional extensions. The set of
     optional extensions implemented by the harts must be identical. Where the
     extension supports optionality in the form of field widths (e.g.,
     ASIDLEN, VLEN, allowed vstart values, physical address width, debug
     triggers, cache-block size, etc.), the implementation of these must also be
     identical. Having an identical ISA on all harts allows system software to
     migrate tasks among the harts without constraints._

| `RVA_040`  | The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MAY support
             different power and performance characteristics but MUST be
             otherwise indistinguishable from each other from a software
             execution viewpoint.
2+| _All harts in the SoC being indistinguishable from a software execution
     viewpoint allows system software to migrate tasks among the harts without
     constraints._

| `RVA_050` a| The RISC-V application processor hart MUST support:

             * Single stepping using the step bit in  `dcsr`
             * Debug scratch register 0 (`dscratch0`)

| `RVA_060` a| The RISC-V application processor hart MUST support:

             * At least 4 instruction address match triggers.
             * At least 4 load/store address match triggers.
             * At least one icount trigger to support single stepping.
             * At least one interrupt trigger.
             * At least one exception trigger.
             * Trigger filtering using `hcontext`.
             * Trigger filtering using all VMID encodings supported by the hart.
             * Trigger filtering using `scontext`.
             * Trigger filtering using all ASID encodings supported by the hart.

| `RVA_070`  | The RISC-V application processor MUST support at least 6 hardware
             performance counters defined by the Zihpm extension in addition to
             the three counters defined by Zicntr extension.
