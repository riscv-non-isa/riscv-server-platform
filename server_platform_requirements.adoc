== Server Platform Hardware Requirements

=== RISC-V Harts

A RISC-V server platform includes one or more RISC-V application processors and may
include one or more service processors. These service processors may provide services
such as security and power management to software executing on the application
processors, and they may themselves implement the RISC-V ISA. The requirements
in this section apply solely to harts in the application processors of the SoC.

| ID#     ^| Requirement
| `RVA_010`  | The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support the
             RVA23 ISA profile cite:[RVA23].

| `RVA_020` a| The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support the
             following extensions:

             * Sv48
             * Svadu
             * Sdtrig
             * Sdext
             * Zkr
             * Ssccfg
             * Sscsrind
             * Ssstrict
             * Ssaia

2+| _Many of these mandated extensions are optional in the RVA23 ISA profile.
     This requirement is placed here as a placeholder. These mandates may be
     moved into a new ISA profile specification._

| `RVA_021` a| The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support
             the Ssctr extension with a CTR depth value of 32. Additional CTR
             depth values MAY be supported.

2+| _Mandating implementation of CTR depth of 32 provides a common CTR depth
     across implementations for purposes of VM migration._

| `RVA_030`  | The ISA extensions and associated CSR field widths implemented by
             any of the RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST be
             identical within a supervisor domain.
2+| _The RVA23 profile supports a set of optional extensions. The set of
     optional extensions implemented by the harts must be identical. Where the
     extension supports optionality in the form of field widths (e.g.,
     ASIDLEN, VLEN, allowed vstart values, physical address width, debug
     triggers, cache-block size, etc.), the implementation of these must also be
     identical. Having an identical ISA on all harts in a supervisor domain
     allows system software to migrate tasks among the harts without
     constraints._

| `RVA_040`  | The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MAY support
             different power and performance characteristics but MUST be
             otherwise indistinguishable from each other from a software
             execution viewpoint within a supervisor domain.
2+| _All harts in a supervisor domain being indistinguishable from a software
     execution viewpoint allows system software to migrate tasks among the harts
     without constraints._

| `RVA_050` a| The RISC-V application processor hart MUST support:

             * Single stepping using the step bit in  `dcsr`
             * Debug scratch register 0 (`dscratch0`)

| `RVA_060` a| The RISC-V application processor hart MUST support:

             * At least 4 instruction address match triggers.
             * At least 4 load/store address match triggers.
             * At least one icount trigger to support single stepping.
             * At least one interrupt trigger.
             * At least one exception trigger.
             * Trigger filtering using `hcontext`.
             * Trigger filtering using all VMID encodings supported by the hart.
             * Trigger filtering using `scontext`.
             * Trigger filtering using all ASID encodings supported by the hart.
2+| _The motivation for including at least four instruction address and four
     load/store address match triggers originates from prior experience with
     x86 servers._

| `RVA_070`  | The RISC-V application processor MUST support at least 6 hardware
             performance counters defined by the Zihpm extension in addition to
             the three counters defined by the Zicntr extension.
2+| _The motivation for including at least six performance counters, in addition
     to the three counters defined by the Zicntr extension, originates from prior
     experience with x86 servers._

    cite:[ServerSoC].  The intention here is to simplify early boot software
    support requirements.  This UART is not intended to be directly assignable
    to virtual machines, and thus there is no requirement for this UART to
    appear as a PCI device.  This specification does not provide guidance around
    how the UART is physically exposed, i.e. via RS232 signalling, USB, a BMC or
    other mechanism._
