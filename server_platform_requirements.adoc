== Server Platform Hardware Rules

=== RISC-V Harts

A RISC-V server platform includes one or more RISC-V application processors and may
include one or more service processors. These service processors may provide services
such as security and power management to software executing on the application
processors, and they may themselves implement the RISC-V ISA. The rules
in this section apply solely to harts in the application processors of the SoC.

| ID#     ^| Rule
| `RVA_010`  | The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support the
             RVA23 ISA profile cite:[RVA23].

| `RVA_020` a| The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support the
             following extensions:

             * Sv48
             * Svadu
             * Sdtrig
             * Sdext
             * Zkr
             * Ssccfg
             * Ssstrict
             * Ssaia

2+| _These mandates may be moved into a new ISA profile specification. The
     motivation for requiring Zkr is that servers typically need access
     to an entropy source at boot time._

| `RVA_021` a| The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST support
             the Ssctr extension with a CTR depth value of 32. Additional CTR
             depth values MAY be supported.

2+| _The motivation for requiring Ssctr is that similar capabilities from other
     architectures are used by profile-guided optimization (PGO) tools to improve
     builds for workloads typical of servers. Mandating implementation of CTR
     depth of 32 provides a common CTR depth across implementations for purposes
     of VM migration._

| `RVA_030`  | The ISA extensions and associated CSR field widths implemented by
             any of the RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MUST be
             identical within a supervisor domain.
2+| _The RVA23 profile supports a set of optional extensions. The set of
     optional extensions implemented by the harts must be identical. Where the
     extension supports optionality in the form of field widths (e.g.,
     ASIDLEN, VLEN, allowed vstart values, physical address width, debug
     triggers, cache-block size, etc.), the implementation of these must also be
     identical. Having an identical ISA on all harts in a supervisor domain
     allows system software to migrate tasks among the harts without
     constraints._

| `RVA_040`  | The RISC-V application processor harts in the SoC MAY support
             different power and performance characteristics but MUST be
             otherwise indistinguishable from each other from a software
             execution viewpoint within a supervisor domain.
2+| _All harts in a supervisor domain being indistinguishable from a software
     execution viewpoint allows system software to migrate tasks among the harts
     without constraints._

| `RVA_050` a| The RISC-V application processor hart MUST support:

             * Single stepping using the step bit in  `dcsr`

| `RVA_060` a| The RISC-V application processor hart MUST support:

             * At least 4 instruction address match triggers.
             * At least 4 load/store address match triggers.
             * At least one icount trigger to support single stepping.
             * At least one interrupt trigger.
             * At least one exception trigger.
             * Trigger filtering using all VMID encodings supported by the hart.
             * Trigger filtering using all ASID encodings supported by the hart.
2+| _The motivation for including at least four instruction address and four
     load/store address match triggers originates from prior experience with
     x86 servers._

| `RVA_070`  | The RISC-V application processor MUST support at least 6 hardware
             performance counters defined by the Zihpm extension in addition to
             the three counters defined by the Zicntr extension.
2+| _The motivation for including at least six performance counters, in addition
     to the three counters defined by the Zicntr extension, originates from prior
     experience with x86 servers._

| `HPER_010`   | For remote-access and system engineering purposes in early boot software, either a
                 fully 16550-compatible cite:[NS16550] or a fully pl011-compatible cite:[pl011] UART
                 MUST be implemented.
2+| _This is a stronger requirement than the Server SoC `MNG_030` rule
    cite:[ServerSoC].  The intention here is to simplify early boot software
    support requirements.  This UART is not intended to be directly assignable
    to virtual machines, and thus there is no requirement for this UART to
    appear as a PCI device.  This specification does not provide guidance around
    how the UART is physically exposed, i.e. via RS232 signalling, USB, a BMC or
    other mechanism._
| `HPER_020`  a| The implemented UART MUST support:

              * Interrupt-driven operation using a wired interrupt.
              * Flow control.

| `FIRM_080` | The firmware SHOULD support the ability to perform a HTTP-based boot from a network device, including support for HTTPS and DNS, supporting relevant HII protocols (cite:[UEFI_platform_specific] number 22).
| `FIRM_090` | The firmware MUST support software that runs from EFI firmware to install Load Option Variables (+Boot####, or Driver####, or SysPrep####+) consistent with cite:[UEFI_platform_specific] number 27.

             a mechanism that cannot be accessed or tampered by an unauthorized
             software or hardware agent.
